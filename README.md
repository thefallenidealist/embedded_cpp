About
-----

Misc stuff which one day will be a C++ port of my C drivers for STM32/AVR and various eBay HW modules (GLCDs, wireless modules, flash, and other embedded HW devices).
Also stuff with which I'll try to learn C++.

For now just PC "simulator", later will be added support for real STM32F1 (and or F4).

If you have ideas/comments about this feel free to contact me.
Also, there would be grammar errors.

Licence
-------

My stuff islicenced under a beerware licence.
ST stuff (STM32 libs/drivers) is under some other licence.
